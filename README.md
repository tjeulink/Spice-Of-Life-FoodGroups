# Spice Of Life FoodGroups
Food groups for spice of life mod, compatible with harvestcraft, tinkers construct, anemania, BoP.

Please help me complete this list by contributing or opening issue tickets for mistakes. I tried my best to fit all foods into the food groups, but some things are bound to be janky since I did it via botanical definition of fruit and vegitables instead of the culinary definition. I made this in the hope it gives modpack makers an easy basis to work with for their foodgroups so most of the hard work is already done. I made these lists completely by hand, copy and pasting every single food individually into the files, it literally took me hours so i hope its of some use to anyone lol.

how to install these foodgroups into your modpack. make sure you have the spice of life installed, then add all the .json files from this repo into your /config/spiceoflife folder. you can also add single .json files if you only want to use for example beverages or sweets, the names are pretty selfexplanitory.

Feel free to modify and/or use it in your modpack as long as you credit me properly and send me an link!
