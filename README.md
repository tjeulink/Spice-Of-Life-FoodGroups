# SpiceOfLifeFoodGroups
Food groups for spice of life mod, compatible with harvestcraft, tinkers construct, anemania, BoP.

Please help me complete this list by contributing or opening issue tickets for mistakes. I tried my best to fit all foods into the food groups, but some things are bound to be janky since I did it via botanical definition of fruit and vegitables instead of the culinary definition. I made this in the hope it gives modpack makers an easy basis to work with for their foodgroups so most of the hard work is already done. I made these lists completely by hand, copy and pasting every single food individually into the files, it literally took me hours so i hope its of some use to anyone lol.
